Hi! I'm not sure why you're looking at this, but I just wanted to say something about those hundreds of commits. I didn't know how web design or git worked at the time I was making this website, so what I was doing was editing the files directly on Github and commiting and looking at the changes. I didn't know I could test locally. Haha
